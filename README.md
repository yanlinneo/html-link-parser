**Hi there, welcome to Neo Yanlin's html-link-parser project.**

This is a project that extract anchor links and text from a HTML file. Inner anchor links are omitted. Codes are written in Go.

Credits to https://github.com/gophercises/link for creating this practise and providing the 4 HTML files for testing purposes:
ex1.html
ex2.html
ex3.html
ex4.html

I also hope to learn as much as I can about Go Programming, so I may be adding other enhancements/ideas to this project. 

**What I have learnt:**
1. Naming Conventions for functions/methods: Keep it simple, avoid excessive reptition. (Updated on 21/08/2024)
2. Adding Test Cases.
3. html.Parse function may have issues if there are other elements nested between two anchor tags. Refer to ex5.html (test case) generated by ChatGPT. To investigate and go through more test cases in the future. (Updated on 22/08/2024)
