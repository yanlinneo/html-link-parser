# HTML Link Parser
- Random HTML Link Parser written in Go
> [!CAUTION]
> This is a personal project created for my own learning purposes.
> **It is not intended for use with production data or in a production environment.**

## Overview
- Extract all outer anchor links and their text from a HTML page.

## Features
- The HTML page is accessed via an API call.
- All inner text elements within an anchor element are joined using a ", " delimiter.
- Inner nested anchor links are omitted. Nesting anchor elements is not standard HTML practice.
- The links are saved into a MySQL database for future analysis and reference.

## Credits
Special thanks to https://github.com/gophercises/link for this practise idea and providing the materials for testing purposes:
- ex1.html
- ex2.html
- ex3.html
- ex4.html

## Other Ideas/Enhancements
- Optimize the speed to remove whitespace such as \t, \n. Current Regex method in my program takes 1s to process 89 links.

## What I Have Learnt

**Whitespace**
- Trim.Space() function is applicable for leading and trailing whitespace.
- Used Regex to remove other whitespace such as \t, \n.
- However, the time taken for Regex to process and remove whitespace is time-consuming. My program takes 1s to process 89 links.

**Nested Anchor Elements**
- ex5.html (test case) originally in this project will be removed for the following reasons:
  - This file contains multiple levels of nested anchor (<a>) elements. When it is loaded in a browser, some of the anchor element links appear duplicated.
  - Inner nested anchor links are not allowed (https://www.w3.org/TR/PR-html40-971107/struct/links.html#h-12.2.2)
  - Anchor elements must not have interactive content (https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#the-a-element)
  - Conducted a test on nested anchor elements. If an anchor element (<a>) is nested directly inside another anchor element, modern browsers will generally treat them as separate, sibling elements, rather than as nested elements.


### 22/08/2024
- (Refer to update on 28/08/2024) ~~html.Parse function may have issues if there are other elements nested between two anchor tags. Refer to ex5.html (test case) generated by ChatGPT. To investigate and go through more test cases in the future.~~

**Naming Conventions for functions/methods**
- Keep it simple, avoid excessive reptition.
