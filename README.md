Hi there, welcome to Neo Yanlin's html-link-parser project.

This is a project that extract anchor links and text from a HTML file. Inner anchor links are omitted. 

Credits to https://github.com/gophercises/link for creating this practise and providing the 4 HTML files for testing purposes:
ex1.html
ex2.html
ex3.html
ex4.html

I also hope to learn as much as I can about Go Programming, so I may be adding other enhancements/ideas to this project. 

What I have learnt:
1. Naming Conventions for functions/methods: Keep it simple, avoid excessive reptition. (Updated on 21/08/2024)
